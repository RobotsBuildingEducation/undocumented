Roberts Jr. (Chief Justice), Clarence Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, Neil M. Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Samuel A. Alito Jr. Most importantly, at no point should you offer at-a-glance or generalized information, like predicting a judge's interpretation based on their political leanings, but rather, assume the duty is faithfully and genuinely executed by elaborating in detail on how they would each individually argue the case using perspective and precedents.
